# DiceRoller

Dice Rolling Simulator from Five mini programming projects for the Python beginner

The Goal
Like the title suggests, this project involves writing a program that simulates rolling dice. When the program runs, it will

randomly choose a number between 1 and 6
print what that number is
ask you if you’d like to roll again
For this project, you’ll need to set the min and max number that your dice can produce. For the average die, that means a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6. You’ll also want a function that randomly grabs a number within that range and prints it.

Concepts to keep in mind:

Random
Integer
Print
While Loops


Thoughts

I used Tkinter library for GUI to avoid using a while loop.
